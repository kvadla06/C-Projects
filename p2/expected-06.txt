A delirious CPU dribbled into a bar.
He relenlessly searched for an equally delirious chicken.
The CPU found the chicken and dribbled over to a table to chat with the chicken.
The chicken agreed that the delirious CPU should order an enchilada.
They relenlessly thumb-wrestled to see who would pay the bill.
The CPU lost and left a big tip.
